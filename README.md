### Note:
- Github is not a place to test your code. Test it on your machines first. Do not exceed 5 commits or your grade will be penalized.
We strongly recommend that you run your finished programs on your local machine/laptop first to test if they are working correctly. You should always test on your laptop first, and then copy the finished code to github. Test your program on your machine using the instructions you received in the lab sessions.
