/*
Develop an object-oriented C++ program that calculates the area and perimeter of various
geometric shapes—Circle, Rectangle, Triangle, and Square—based on user input. The program
must be designed using inheritance and polymorphism, with a base class Shape and derived
classes for each geometric type. The system should ensure that all inputs are valid (i.e., positive
numbers) and display results clearly.


Note:
- Program must be written in C++
- Create an abstract base class Shape with two pure virtual methods and implement derived classes using that
- Each class must override the base class methods using appropriate formulas


  See PDF for sample input/output
